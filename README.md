# Hello!

My name is Sahba, and I'm currently studying UX and Machine Learning at UC San Diego. I'm passionate about creating smarter systems and discovering hidden problems. Scroll down to see my existing projects!

## CruiseCTRL
Our initial prompt for this assignment was to design an application centered around presenting some type of information in a more intuitive way. My team's application went through many iterations and functions, and landed on becoming an offline go-to drivers manual, equipped with FAQs and expert help for drivers in need of immediate assistance.

## DisneyLines
More along the lines of social computing, my team's objective for this particular project was to build an online social environment for people coinhabiting a physical space. After assessing potential scenarios that could be enhanced with an online environment, we decided upon improving the ever-present and intrinsically "boring" act of waiting in line. Specifically, my team designed a potential application in which park goers could battle each other in themed games while waiting to ride their favorite attractions at Disney.
